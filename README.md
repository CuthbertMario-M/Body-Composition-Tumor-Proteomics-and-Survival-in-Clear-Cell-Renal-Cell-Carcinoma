# Project Summary
  
This project investigates the relationship between body composition, tumor proteomics, and survival outcomes in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using CT-derived body composition measures and large-scale proteomic datasets, we identified distinct associations between body composition phenotypes, differential protein expression, and patient prognosis.
  ðŸ§   Our findings highlight the potential of integrating imaging-based body composition profiling with molecular characterization to uncover prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in ccRCC. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of tumor biology and patient heterogeneity, with implications for precision oncology and improved risk stratification.

  ðŸ“„ More details about the research will be provided after publication.
